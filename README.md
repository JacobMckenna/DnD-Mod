# DnD Mod

## Overview
This is a Hearts of Iron 4 mod that recreates our Dungeons and Dragons campaign, Echoes of Legends, into the game.

## Details
Included in the mod will be a new custom made map that is based on the map of Elandria in our Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
There will also be custom leaders based off of the characters in our campaign, custom countries based on the kingdoms and regions in the campaign,
and possibly custom focus trees for each of the custom countries.
